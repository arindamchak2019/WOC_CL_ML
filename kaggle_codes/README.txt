Hello There!
These 2 codes were made first, with barebones Logistical Regression
The value of lambda 3, was found after trial and error for V2.0
I had also attempted trial and error code, but it got a lower score in the private leaderboard.
I had also implemented Regularization, after seeing how low an error I was getting, fearing Overfitting
